Detailed Requirements for the Business Rules Document Generation App
1. Project Overview
Develop a Python application that automates the generation of Word documents based on business rules provided in an Excel file. The application will:
	•	Read business rules from an Excel file, extracting specific fields.
	•	Invoke the OpenAI API for each rule to generate additional required information.
	•	Generate a Word document for each rule using a predefined template, maintaining the provided structure.
	•	Fill the template with both the extracted and AI-generated information.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Input Handling
	•	FR1: The application shall accept an Excel file (.xlsx format) containing business rules.
	•	FR2: The Excel file structure shall be configurable, allowing mapping of column names to expected fields in the application.
	•	FR3: The application shall validate the Excel file to ensure all required fields are present: Rule ID, Severity (Error or Warning), and Description.
2.2. Data Processing
	•	FR4: The application shall read and parse each business rule from the Excel file, extracting:
	◦	Rule ID
	◦	Severity: Error or Warning
	◦	Description
	•	FR5: For each rule, the application shall invoke the OpenAI API to generate the following additional information:
	◦	Title Domain + Rule ID
	◦	Brief Description (if further elaboration is needed)
	◦	Mapping Table Content:
	▪	XML Element: The XML element the rule applies to.
	▪	JSON Element: The corresponding JSON element after conversion.
	◦	Rule Condition
	◦	Rule Expressed in Pseudocode
	◦	Any additional explanations or details as required by the Word template.
	•	FR6: The application shall ensure that the AI-generated content is accurate and relevant to the rule's context.
2.3. Document Generation
	•	FR7: The application shall use the provided Word document template (.docx format) with a fixed structure and placeholders for dynamic content.
	•	FR8: The application shall fill in the template with both the extracted and AI-generated information for each rule.
	•	FR9: The application shall generate a separate Word document for each rule, preserving the template's structure and formatting.
	•	FR10: The generated documents shall include all sections as specified in the template, such as titles, descriptions, mapping tables, conditions, pseudocode, and applied XML elements.
2.4. OpenAI API Integration
	•	FR11: The application shall invoke the OpenAI API for every rule without exception.
	•	FR12: The OpenAI API shall be used to generate all required information not provided in the Excel file.
	•	FR13: The application shall handle API rate limits and errors gracefully, including retry mechanisms and informative error messages.
	•	FR14: The application shall comply with OpenAI's usage policies, including content guidelines and API terms of service.
2.5. Configuration
	•	FR15: The application shall allow configuration of:
	◦	Excel file path.

2.6. Error Handling
	•	FR16: The application shall handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages for:
	◦	Missing or invalid Excel files.
	◦	Missing required fields in the Excel data.
	◦	Issues with the Word template (e.g., missing placeholders).
	◦	OpenAI API errors (e.g., network issues, API limits, invalid responses).
2.7. Logging
	•	FR17: The application shall log processing steps and errors to a log file for debugging and audit purposes.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

3.5. Security
	•	NFR7: Sensitive information, such as the OpenAI API key, must be securely managed and not hard-coded in the source code.
	•	NFR8: The application should protect against injection attacks or malicious data in the Excel file.
3.6. Compliance
	•	NFR9: The application must comply with OpenAI's API usage policies, including rate limits and content guidelines.

4. Technical Specifications
4.1. Technologies and Libraries
	•	Programming Language: Python 3.x
	•	Libraries:
	◦	pandas: For reading and processing Excel files.
	◦	python-docx: For working with Word documents.
	◦	openai: For interacting with the OpenAI API.
	◦	logging: For logging application activities.
	◦	dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.
4.2. Excel File Structure
The Excel file should contain the following columns:
	•	Rule ID: Unique identifier for the rule.
	•	Severity: Indicator of whether the rule is an Error or a Warning.
	•	Description: A description of the rule.
4.3. OpenAI API Usage

5. Use Cases
5.1. Document Generation with AI Integration
Actor: User
Precondition: The user has an Excel file with business rules and the provided Word template with the correct placeholders.
Main Flow:
	1	The user configures the application paths and settings in the configuration file.
	2	The user runs the application.
	3	The application reads the Excel file and extracts the required fields for each rule.
	4	For each rule, the application constructs prompts and invokes the OpenAI API to generate the additional required information.
	5	The application fills the Word template with both the extracted and AI-generated information.
	6	The application saves the generated document in the output directory.
Postcondition: Word documents are generated for each rule, fully populated with the necessary information, preserving the template's structure.
5.2. Error Handling
Actor: User
Scenario: The OpenAI API returns an error or invalid response.
Main Flow:
	1	The application attempts to invoke the OpenAI API for a rule.
	2	The API returns an error (e.g., rate limit exceeded, invalid API key).
	3	The application logs the error with details.
	4	The application retries the API call if appropriate (e.g., after a delay for rate limits).
	5	If the error persists, the application skips the rule or terminates, providing an informative error message to the user.
Postcondition: The user is informed of the issue and can take corrective action.
